# NanoBench

This is a simple portable hardware tool that allows for easy, multifunctional, visual development and testing.  The [Arduino Nano](https://www.arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=Main/ArduinoBoardNano) is a relatively inexpensive MCU board, with mulitple ports which can be used to drive a [ILI9341 tft display](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ILI9341.pdf) and read and write digital and analogue signals.  The NanoBench utilises this to create a reusable base for modular sense and control applications which benefit from having a display.  Extender Modules are thus developed to take advantage of the readily accessible ports and the permanaent display. [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) have helpfully published drivers for this display, making this a simple project.  Similar devices can be easily made with other MCU units with more features, and I will make them to be compatible with the extender modules.
