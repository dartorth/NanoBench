# NanoBench

This is a simple portable hardware tool that allows for easy, multifunctional, visual development and testing.  The [Arduino Nano](https://www.arduino.cc/en/pmwiki.php?n=Main/ArduinoBoardNano) is a relatively inexpensive MCU board, with mulitple ports which can be used to drive a [ILI9341 tft display](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/ILI9341.pdf) and read and write digital and analogue signals.  The NanoBench utilises this to create a reusable base for modular sense and control applications which benefit from having a display.  Extender Modules are thus developed to take advantage of the readily accessible ports and the permanaent display. [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) have helpfully published drivers for this display, making this a simple project.  Similar devices can be easily made with other MCU units with more features, and I will make them to be compatible with the extender modules.   

![Version 0.1](https://github.com/saiftynet/NanoBench/blob/main/Images/nanobench.jpg)

In this version the nano board is exposed to allow access to the reset button, LEDs.  There an ON off switch.  The power pins are brought out to headers on either side of the box (one side for 5V, the other for 3.3V, an I2C port is positioned at the back of the box...not visible. In the front the remaining pins are made available for extender modules.
